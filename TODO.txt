What changes need to be made to the existing code 
and which new feature need to be introduced in order to implement NEAT.

[CHANGE] Activation Function:
Because of the way the new nets are generated the old activation function does not work anymore.
The function needs to be modified appropriately.
The challenge is not to find a function that works but a function that works efficiently.
Obviously, the activation function will be called very often so optimization is crucial.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________
[CHANGE] Initial NN generation:
For NEAT the neural nets start out minimal.
I.e. every node on the input layer is connected to every node on the output layer.
There are no hidden nodes at all. All hidden nodes are generated later through NEAT.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________
[NEW] Genomes:
Instead of saving the NNs as a matrix of connection weights and biases they are saved as two sets of Genomes.
One for the nodes and one for the connection between them.
Contained within the Genomes as well is the historical marking of each mutation.
The historical markings are the base for most essential methods of the NEAT algorithm.

Example from the paper:
Node Genes: 	[Node 1, Sensor],
		[Node 2, Sensor],
		[Node 3, Sensor],
		[Node 4, Output],
		[Node 5, Hidden]

Connect.Genes:	[In 1, Out 4, Weight  0.7,  Enabled, Innovation 1]
		[In 2, Out 4, Weight -0.5, Disabled, Innovation 2]
		[In 3, Out 4, Weight  0.5,  Enabled, Innovation 3]
		[In 2, Out 5, Weight  0.2,  Enabled, Innovation 4]
		[In 5, Out 4, Weight  0.4,  Enabled, Innovation 5]
		[In 1, Out 5, Weight  0.6,  Enabled, Innovation 6]
		[In 4, Out 5, Weight  0.6,  Enabled, Innovation 11]

The genotype produces the phenotype, the phenotype being the neural net itself.
Slight adjustments will need to be made s.t. one bot contains a three seperate genotypes for three NNs.
When two bots mate, the respective genotypes for each net will be crossed over.
(So that the playing net doesnt cross over with the bidding net.)

[NEW] Evolution Process
The Evolution Process will be changed entirely.
While before, the champion of each generation was mutated randomly, the process is refined significantly.
New features need to be introduced: Mating, Speciation and Topologic Evolution.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________
[NEW] Diagnostics
Implement a non-hacky function to monitor what is going on inside the algorithm.

[CHANGE] Information Sets
Is the information set that the bot recieves in the game sufficient.
-->Should be reviewed
