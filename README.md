## Magic Man - NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) Branch


This branch was created in order to implement a far more sophisticated algorithm for evolving NNs.
The planned implementation is based on a [paper](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/106365602320169811 "Stanley K., Miikkulainen R. (2002)") by K.O. Stanley and R. Miikkulainen that was published back in 2002 in the MIT Press Journals.
In their paper, K. Stanley and R. Miikulainen outline an algorithm that introduces new features to existing methods.
These new features significantly improve their performance.
The main feature introduced by the authors is the evolution of the topolgy of the neural net in addition to its connectivity.
Beyond that, the authors introduce other innovative mechanisms such as Speciation, starting from minimal structure and an improved method for mating to further improve the performance.

## Motivation and Goals
I implemented the algorithm in the current master branch mostly in order to learn about Neuroevolution.
More specifically - to encounter the most basic problems that have to be solved in order to make a genetic algorithm solve the given task.
Since the current implementation did not achieve much in the sense of maximum fitness, the idea is to turn to more refined approaches in order to achieve better results.
Beyond the results, the motivation is to learn more about Neuroevolution and its practical challenges.

## Challenges
As mentioned in the master branch, the element of chance in the game Wizard will probably remain a problem for the NEAT algorithm.
This concern is appropriate. Mostly because in their paper, K.Stanley and R.Mikkulainen exclusively apply the algorithm to tasks that lack any element of chance.
(XOR gate, Pole Balancing, Double Pole Balancing - with and without velocities)
Training time could be increased significantly by this.
Implementing biases to the nodes of the neural nets. This might improve learning.
Playing a game now takes about 0.5 to 1.5 seconds longer. Depending on the improvement this might be worth it.

## Results

The NEAT algorithm so far has perfomed considerably worse than the fixed topology approach.
While the fixed topology neural nets stalled at about 70 points average score the neural nets trained with NEAT stopped improving around 40.

The bots were started without full connectivity as described in the reference paper, i.e. instead of every sensor node being connected to every output node, no connections were there to begin with.
The completely disconnected net performs much better.
If there are is full connectivity between the sensors and the output nodes, average score stalls at about negative 50.

## Speciation 

Speciation works almost perfectly. It is more volatile than the reference papers results but it seems to work as anticipated

The compatibility threshold Î´ is set to 2.25, C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> are set to 2, and C<sub>3</sub> is set to 0.7
As in the reference paper there are no particular reasons for these values and they are set through trial and error.

## Neural Nets

The bid nets in some cases formed sensible patterns.

The figure shows the topmost nodes to increase the activation of the bid nets output node.
The nodes correspond to the 4 magicians, which almost always win a trick.
Connections like these seem sensible and are evidence of the algorithm working as intended.

The playing strategies are much less intuitive and therefore more complicated.
The figure shows the net that determines which card the bot wants to play.
I have serious doubts that this neural net is of any use whatsoever but I have not bothered comparing the bots performance to a similar bot with no connections in the play net.

## Conclusion

I either did not apply the NEAT algorithm correctly or the task is too comlicated for a net to evolve into a valid solution.
I will try a fixed topology gradient descend method next.
