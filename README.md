# Magic Man

I implemented a game based on the cardgame "Wizard" and want to train bots to play it.
The projects goal is to improve to a point where the bots are as good or better than human players.

## Fixed Topology Approach

The first approach was generating neural nets of fixed topology and reproducing them depending on their performance.
Results from this currently implemented method have been good but do not reach the goal of matching a human player.
While an average human player scores an average score of about 250 in any given game, the bots reach a maximum average score of about 60 before they stall out.
